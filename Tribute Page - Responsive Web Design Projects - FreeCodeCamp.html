          He moved from Austria to California and became the youngest ever Mr Olympia Champion, aged 23. He went on to become a 7 time Mr Olympia Champion and a 4 time Mr Universe Winner.

          By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. He started with a bricklaying business. He used the profits from that to start a mail order business. Then, he invested those profits in real estate and other investments.

        <p class="info-paragraphs container">
          He struggled at the beginning and was told many times that he should give up because his accent was too strong and his body was too big. He used these to his advantage and became the highest paid actor in 1991. His film "Terminator 2: Judgement Day" grossed over $500 million. He was a 1977 Golden Globe Award winner and he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

        <p class="info-paragraphs container">
          In 2013, he became the governor of California, the higest attainable position in politics for a person who wasn't born in the United States.
