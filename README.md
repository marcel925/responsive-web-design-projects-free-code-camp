# responsive-web-design-projects-free-code-camp
Responsive Web Design Projects - created as part of earning the Web Design Certification from FreeCodeCamp.org. 
(None of the code was copied from anywhere, all written by me)

These projects involve just HTML and CSS, and I also use Boostrap. I made the code look as good and as clear as possible.

I made sure that these projects look great on mobile. I also made sure they look good on screens of any size.

The certification estimates 300 hours of course work.
